						<p> <!--&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-->
							I am a fourth year student at Purdue University seeking a career in the Information Technology field. 
							To get to where I am now, I have worked diligently in classes and with various employers to offset my education expenses. 
							I started my first job serving which lead into positions tending bar across the city. Thanks to my customer service roots, 
							I developed strong interpersonal communication skills, focusing on collaboration. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							My interest in computers is lifelong; this passion for technology led me to take various college-level computer classes 
							in high school, and further still to earn various certifications. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, I am a Cyber Security Intern at Trustwave working with the SpiderLabs Threat Intelligence Team under supervision 
							of the Threat Intelligence Global Lead, Jeremy Batterman. Working at Trustwave has afforded me the opportunity to gain useful 
							working knowledge of cyber threats, security, and malware analysis. Not only have I been able to gain knowledge about the 
							security industry, but I have also been able to work on many other projects as well. I have had the opportunity to work on a 
							web-based malware organizational program. Working with Trustwave has allowed me to procure many different applicable skills, 
							as well as related certificates.
						</p>
						<p>
							I enjoy working in this field and look to further my exposure. Cyber security, software development, website design, 
							and many other creative and analytic aspects of this field drew me to pressure a career in this field, but it's the variety of
							opportunities available that has kept my interest. I am well-versed in code and hardware, as well as design and construction. 
							I enjoy the creative process involved in project development; this website was created as much for fun as it was for purpose. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Have a look around, and please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments.
