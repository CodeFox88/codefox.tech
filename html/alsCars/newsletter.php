    <h3 align="left">Mercedes Benz BIOME</h3>
       <p class="body_text"><img src="assets/newsletter1.jpg" alt="news1" width="380" height="250" class="img_left_float" />Mercedes Benz is often at the forefront of car technologies and they have now even looked to completely change not just the cars themselves, but how they are actually made. The BIOME car, which was first revealed at the Los Angeles Design Challenge, is a completely unique idea that sees a car that rather than being manufactured completely on a production line, could instead be grown. Featuring natural materials, Mercedes Benz sees the BIOME as a possible future for the motor industry, utilizing the resources given off by nature in conjunction with the latest technology. The biggest feature is a specially grown material called BioFibre that is incredibly light but also super strong.</p>
    <h3 align="right">Kia Pop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
    <p class="body_text"><img src="assets/newsletter2.jpg" alt="Dogwood" width="360" height="230" class="img_right_float" />With car manufacturers increasingly looking at utilizing new types of technology to power their vehicles, to help combat global warming and in response to the limited supply of fossil fuels, one of the most important advances has come in the form of the electric car. Kia demonstrated their answer to the electric motor with the Kia Pop. With a distinctive design that would look more at home in a science-fiction movie, it features a lightweight design so that the vehicle can be more efficient. This allows the electric motor to travel almost 100 miles per charge, making it ideal for travelling in urban areas.</p>
    <h3>Cadillac Aera</h3>
    <p class="body_text"><img src="assets/newsletter3.jpg" alt="Hostas" width="350" height="202" class="img_left_float" />The Cadillac Aera was the General Motors Advanced Design California studioâ€™s answer to creating a car that would be luxurious, reliable, efficient and stylish. The 2+2 couple features an ultra-lightweight design that aims to be as aerodynamic as possible, making it incredibly fuel-efficient. The structure itself is made from a special material that makes it strong enough to withstand even exceptional impacts, with special air cells woven into the material that reduce the forces experienced in the vehicle. Most important to the Aera though is its Pneumatic Drive System, which uses an engine powered by compressed air that could have a range of more than 1,000 miles.</p>
